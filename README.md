# IMAGEFY
📸 Imagify – AI Text-to-Image Generator

Imagify is an AI-powered Text-to-Image Generation Tool that transforms natural language descriptions into high-quality images using advanced deep learning models. Built with a user-friendly web interface, the project integrates Flask, Bootstrap, and the Hugging Face Inference API (Stable Diffusion) to provide seamless text-to-image conversion.

The system allows users to simply type a descriptive prompt (e.g., “a futuristic city skyline at sunset” or “a cat playing guitar in cartoon style”) and instantly generates a corresponding image. This makes Imagify a powerful tool for designers, content creators, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who need quick visualizations.
